The file BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist is a Codeless Language Module for the Mac
OS X text editor BBEdit (http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/), at least
for version 9.x and possibly earlier versions may be supported.

To use it, simply copy that file into this directory (which you might have
to create):

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Language\ Modules

... and BBEdit will load it when it is next launched.

The CLM empowers BBEdit to syntax color PTMD_STD dialect Muldis D code,
and to scan it for major entity (eg, routine and type) declarations so you
can easily jump around to those in your Muldis D code files.

The CLM will automatically be applied to any text files with the filename
extension ".md" (subject to change) but you can apply it to any file.

Be aware that BBEdit_LM_Muldis_D.plist is only as completely defined as the
PTMD_STD dialect itself and in particular the special syntax to define
routines and types etc isn't even defined yet; for now the function scanner
will just match things like "name => Name:foo", but that will be replaced
soon.  Also, the syntax coloring is more rudimentary than the actual
grammar, and certainly can stand to be refactored for better accuracy
whenever I figure out more on how to properly write CLM's.

Over time I expect that Muldis D language modules for other text editors
will be created, as well as syntax coloring utilities for web display of
code, etc.  Meanwhile, what we have here is a reasonable start.
