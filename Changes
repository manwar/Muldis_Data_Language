                                  Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-06-20

    * Muldis::D version 0.130.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.130.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features multiple concrete syntax changes.  The largest
    change is the elimination of the "$" sigil that was used
    semi-gratuitously to mark data-entities (variables, parameters,
    attributes, named expression nodes).  These are now regularly formatted
    as barewords instead, like most languages and SQL, but unlike Perl.
    Likewise eliminated the "|" sigil for named statement nodes.  Another
    significant change is the renaming or elimination of all language
    keywords that had consisted of just a single latin character, meaning
    that users can define any single-letter entity names without ambiguity.
    Also renamed a syntax shorthand from ">foo" to "=>foo" for clarity.

    * (D.pm, README)  Updated the list of email forums focusing on
    Muldis D and its implementations, first to add a 4th list
    muldis-d-language, and second to update all 4 lists' descriptions.

    * (Text.pod)  Renamed function "accents_stripped" to "marks_stripped".

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated a few external reference urls.

    * (Array.pod, Bag.pod, Blob.pod, Boolean.pod, Cast.pod, Integer.pod,
    Interval.pod, Numeric.pod, Ordered.pod, Rational.pod, Relation.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, STDIO.pod, Scalar.pod, Set.pod, Stringy.pod,
    Text.pod, Tuple.pod, Universal.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated
    all system-defined routine documentation so that the illustrative
    declarations of each now just have the unqualified routine names, same
    as the real declarations would, rather than being fully-qualified; the
    level-2 heading for each routine description already has the latter.
    In Routines_Catalog.pod, also upd th 2 named constraint descs likewise.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the shorthand syntax for "foo=>foo" that
    looked like ">foo" to instead look like "=>foo"; people kept confusing
    the old format for the greater-than op; the new should be more obvious.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Universal.pod, Set.pod)
    Removed 2 func invo alt syn exprs: "d" (prefix), "//d" (infix).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Stringy.pod, Cast.pod)
    Renamed 3 func invo alt syn exprs: "x" -> "~#" (infix),
    "t" -> "%" (prefix), "r" -> "@" (prefix).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Set.pod)  Removed the func
    invo alt syn expr "s" (prefix) and updated any code examples using it
    from "s foo" to "Maybe:{foo}".  Converted the func invo alt syn expr
    "v" (Maybe.attr) from prefix format to postcircumfix format; using it
    now looks like "foo.{}" (empty curly quote pair) rather than "v foo".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section "RESOLVING AMBIGUITY"
    which talks about language keywords versus user-defined entities.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Eliminated the
    "|" sigil from statement names, which are now always sigil-less (and
    typically barewords) instead.  In PTMD_STD, a "stmt_name" grammar token
    is now just a "Name_payload".  In the 2 Perl-STD, the first elem of the
    "stmt_name" node kind is now "s" rather than "|" (so in Perl 6 this is
    usually a Pair); for "named_stmt" it is now "::=" rather than "|::=".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Eliminated the
    "$" sigil from data-entity names, which are now always sigil-less (and
    typically barewords) instead.  In PTMD_STD, a "lex_entity_name" grammar
    token is now just a "Name_payload".  In the 2 Perl-STD, the first elem
    of the "expr_name" and "var_name" node kinds are now "d" rather than
    "$" (so in Perl 6 this is usually a Pair); for an "accessor" node it is
    now "acc" rather than "$.".

    * (Array.pod, Bag.pod, Blob.pod, Boolean.pod, Cast.pod, Integer.pod,
    Interval.pod, Numeric.pod, Ordered.pod, Rational.pod, Relation.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, STDIO.pod, Scalar.pod, Set.pod, Stringy.pod,
    Text.pod, Tuple.pod, Universal.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated
    all system-defined routine documentation as per the prior change item,
    so the illustrative routine signatures no longer use the "$" sigils.

2010-05-17

    * Muldis::D version 0.129.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.129.1.tar.gz.

    * (D.pm, README, Makefile.PL)  Updated any instances of
    "http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo" so that they are fully
    lower-cased, because the mixed case version doesn't work with some web
    browsers; browsers that don't automatically convert it to lowercase get
    a "There currently are no publically-advertised mailman lists" message.

    * Purged this distribution's "Changes" file of practically all change
    details for its approximately 147 releases numbered 0.0.0 thru 0.129.0,
    most of those now just constituting a single bullet-point in total.  If
    you want to see those change descriptions, look either in the version
    control system as of tag "release-0.129.0" or in the archived
    distribution tarball named Muldis-D-0.129.0.tar.gz.

    * This is the Muldis-D-0.129.1 file manifest:

    * Language::MuldisD version 0.3.0 was released on CPAN as
    Language-MuldisD-0.3.0.tar.gz.  This was the first time that the Muldis
    D language spec was released as its own distribution, a practice which
    had continued uninterrupted through the present day.  The spec's root
    document had the name Language::MuldisD, starting here with then
    version 0.3.0.

    * This was the Language-MuldisD-0.3.0 file manifest:

2007-06-20 thru 2007-07-20

    * On 2007-06-20 was the very first CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5", version 0.0.0; it
    bundled the very first CPAN release of "Muldis D" the language spec,
    version 0.0.0.  At this time, the entire existing Muldis D language
    spec was contained in the single file "Language.pod", which had the
    name Muldis::DB::Language.

    * 2007-06-29 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.0.1.

    * 2007-07-11 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.1.0.

    * On 2007-07-20 was the very last CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5" that bundled the
    Muldis D language spec, version 0.2.0.  After this time the two would
    be released separately, in their own namespaces.

2006-09-15 thru 2007-06-02

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  It is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C. J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

2002-11-12 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * The very first CPAN release of anything related to Rosetta was on
    2003-01-05, in the form of DBIx::Portable version 0.01, as
    DBIx-Portable-0.01.tar.gz.

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis D language specification.
