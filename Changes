    * QDRDBMS Release 0.0.0/0.000000 (GIT rXXXXX).

    * This is the first release of the QDRDBMS distribution, and the first
    release of any distribution to contain modules named QDRDBMS::*.

    * QDRDBMS is the first successor of the now-defunct Rosetta DBMS
    framework, which it is heavily based on and has learned from, though
    for all practical purposes, QDRDBMS is a complete rewrite with
    significant changes.  Given the magnitude of the differences, the
    actual change history of Rosetta itself is not relevant, and so QDRDBMS
    does not continue its version numbering or maintain the older change
    log.  The first QDRDBMS release on CPAN is version 0.0.0.  But QDRDBMS
    does still declare copyright of 2002-present, incorporating the Rosetta
    development/release time-period.

    * TO REWRITE!!! --> Initial code file versions are: QDRDBMS.pm and
    Value.pm and Model.pm and Util.pm and Example.pm 0.0.0.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

        TODO!!!
