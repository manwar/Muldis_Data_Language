                                  Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2010-07-16

    * Muldis::D version 0.135.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.135.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features a cleanup/consolidation of the postcircumfix
    operator syntaxes, and a renaming of the sub/superset infix ops.

    * (Types.pod)  Added new mixin type "Attributive" that is intended to
    be explicitly composed by other types that are considered to be
    collections of named attributes, such as generic tuples and relations.
    Also updated the 2 types "Tuple", "Relation" to compose "Attributive".

    * Added new initially empty file lib/Muldis/D/Core/Attributive.pod
    which will hold virtual routines for types composing the "Attributive"
    type.  Also updated the README file, Core.pod to mention the new file.

    * (Attributive.pod, Tuple.pod, Relation.pod)  In Attributive.pod, added
    the 8 new virtual functions ["degree", "is_[|not_]nullary",
    "has_attrs", "attr_names", "rename", "projection", "cmpl_proj",
    "static_exten", "[|cmpl_|un]wrap"] and 4 new virtual updaters
    ["assign_rename", "assign_static_exten", "assign_projection",
    "assign_cmpl_proj"].  Then in each of Tuple.pod and Relation.pod,
    updated the 12 same-named routines so that they explicitly implement
    the same-named new virtuals; also consolidated the updated routines.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Attributive.pod, Tuple.pod,
    Relation.pod)  For each of the 6 functions ["rename", "projection",
    "cmpl_proj", "[|cmpl_|un]wrap"], merged the pair of
    tuple|relation-specific formats of its postcircumfix syntax into a
    single format that works for both types; the postcircumfix syntax will
    now invoke the 6 virtual functions rather than their 12 implementers.
    For example, we used to have "%{%<-}","@{%<-}" and we now have "{%<-}".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Scalar.pod, Tuple.pod,
    Relation.pod, Set.pod)  Renamed all remaining postcircumfix op variants
    that had a [$,%,@] sigil preceding the opening curly brace so to remove
    that sigil.  All "${...}" were renamed to "{;...}", the ".{}" (Just)
    was renamed to ".{*}", and any other renames simply removed the sigils.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, Relation.pod)  Renamed the ASCII variants of all 8
    dyadic infix subset/superset operators so that they now are symbolic in
    appearance rather than alphabetic.  For examples, "⊆" is now mapped to
    "{<=}", not "sub", and "⊅" is now mapped to "{!>}", not "!psuper".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Fix a fossil from v0.130.0 re "x" -> "~#" in grammar.

2010-07-13

    * Muldis::D version 0.134.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.134.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[5|6]_STD.pod, Basics.pod, Types_Catalog.pod)
    For PTMD_STD and HDMD_Perl5_STD, updated the formats of numeric and
    blob literals, and of character escape sequences that spell Unicode
    codepoints, so that it is easier to write numbers in a radix other than
    10.  Still unchanged is that you can write numbers either in a general
    form of "M;NNN" for bases 2..35 or in just base-10 as "NNN".  Now, the
    general form adds aliases for the common bases of 2,8,10,16 such that
    the "M" may alternately be spelled "b","o","d","x".  For bases 2,8,16
    this new form is now the recommended one.  PTMD_STD Int example:
    "o;5703"; Blob example: "b;'110010010'"; Text example: "'\c<x;2A1D>'".

    * (HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod)  Updated the code examples for Int and Rat
    literals using bases 2,8,16 to use Perl 6's 0bN,0oN,0xN numeric formats
    rather than its :M<N> format.

    * (HDMD_Perl5_STD.pod)  Updated the code examples for Int literals
    using bases 2,8,16 to use Perl 5's 0bN,0N,0xN numeric formats rather
    than Perl5-STD's single-elem-hash-ref format.  The code examples for
    Rat literals had no corresponding update as Perl 5 doesn't support it.

    * (HDMD_Perl6_STD.pod)  Now that the Perl 6 spec (S02) finally (as of a
    2010.07.12 update) says what a Perl 6 Blob literal looks like
    (":2{NNN}", ":8{NNN}", ":16{NNN}"), updated the Perl6-STD example code
    denoting Perl 6 Blob lits to that from temp stand-in "Blob.new(...)".

2010-07-09

    * Muldis::D version 0.133.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.133.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features some concrete syntax additions to make Muldis D
    code easier to write, to be more terse while still readable.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod)  For all 3 STD, updated the
    formats of generic scalar or tuple or relation value literals so that
    they may be written more tersely.  Now, one may substitute "$","%","@"
    respectively for "Scalar","Tuple","Relation" as the "value_kind"
    leading part of a "value" node.  That is, for example, in PTMD_STD,
    the 3 ["Scalar:MyType:{...}", "Tuple:{...}", "Relation:{...}"] may now
    alternately be spelled ["$:MyType:{...}", "%:{...}", "@:{...}"].

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  For just PTMD_STD, updated the formats specific to
    set, array, bag, and interval value literals so that they may be
    written more tersely.  Now, one may omit the "value_kind" leading part
    of a "value" node when writing most of these.  For examples:
    a Set: "{25,43,6}"; an Array: "['here','there','everywhere']";
    a Bag: "{'Plum' => 200, 'Cherry' => 100, 'Apricot' => 300}";
    an SPInterval: "{21..30}"; an MPInterval: "{-Inf..3,14,266..Inf}".

2010-07-07

    * Muldis::D version 0.132.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.132.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features some reworking of char escape sequences.  The
    prior way of doing this could give the false impression that PTMD_STD
    couldn't be single-pass parsed; the new way should avoid that problem,
    and also result in string literals that are easier for people to read.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  A backslash pair used inside a long string/etc
    literal, to support splitting the literal over multiple code lines, now
    surrounds mandatory whitespace rather than optional whitespace.  In the
    grammar, this pair is now called a "splitter" rather than an "unspace".
    (Another backslash pair, outside strings/etc, is still an "unspace".)

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Removed the simple char escape seq for "space" char,
    which had limited utility; instead of "\s", one can say "\c<F;20>".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated any of the simple char escape sequences that
    differed from those of typical other languages so that they are the
    same instead.  The escape sequences for the 5 characters [\,',",`,#]
    are now simply the same characters with a leading backslash, instead of
    a backslash+alpha; they used to be [\b,\a,\q,\g,\h].  A consequence
    is that a string may now contain the same literal char as is used to
    delimit that string, like typ langs, where this used to be disallowed.

2010-06-23

    * Muldis::D version 0.131.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.131.0.tar.gz.

    * (PTMD_STD)  Fixed semantic-reversing typo.

    * (Types.pod, Types_Catalog.pod, PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod,
    Basics.pod, Relation.pod, Set.pod)  Renamed the nonscalar types
    "Single","DHSingle" to "Just","DHJust" and the corresponding type name
    prefix from "single_of." to "just_of." and the corresponding concrete
    syntax value literal kind from "Single" to "Just".  So now the triple
    of related types/values "Maybe","Just","Nothing" match the names of
    their counterparts in the Haskell language.  So now the canonical
    syntax for selecting a Maybe value is either "Just:{foo}" or "Nothing".
    In Set.pod, renamed the "single" function to "just", and updated the
    "order" function to rename 3 of its parameters from "S" to "J".

2010-06-20

    * Muldis::D version 0.130.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.130.0.tar.gz.

    * This release features multiple concrete syntax changes.  The largest
    change is the elimination of the "$" sigil that was used
    semi-gratuitously to mark data-entities (variables, parameters,
    attributes, named expression nodes).  These are now regularly formatted
    as barewords instead, like most languages and SQL, but unlike Perl.
    Likewise eliminated the "|" sigil for named statement nodes.  Another
    significant change is the renaming or elimination of all language
    keywords that had consisted of just a single latin character, meaning
    that users can define any single-letter entity names without ambiguity.
    Also renamed a syntax shorthand from ">foo" to "=>foo" for clarity.

    * (D.pm, README)  Updated the list of email forums focusing on
    Muldis D and its implementations, first to add a 4th list
    muldis-d-language, and second to update all 4 lists' descriptions.

    * (Text.pod)  Renamed function "accents_stripped" to "marks_stripped".

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated a few external reference urls.

    * (Array.pod, Bag.pod, Blob.pod, Boolean.pod, Cast.pod, Integer.pod,
    Interval.pod, Numeric.pod, Ordered.pod, Rational.pod, Relation.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, STDIO.pod, Scalar.pod, Set.pod, Stringy.pod,
    Text.pod, Tuple.pod, Universal.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated
    all system-defined routine documentation so that the illustrative
    declarations of each now just have the unqualified routine names, same
    as the real declarations would, rather than being fully-qualified; the
    level-2 heading for each routine description already has the latter.
    In Routines_Catalog.pod, also upd th 2 named constraint descs likewise.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Updated the shorthand syntax for "foo=>foo" that
    looked like ">foo" to instead look like "=>foo"; people kept confusing
    the old format for the greater-than op; the new should be more obvious.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Universal.pod, Set.pod)
    Removed 2 func invo alt syn exprs: "d" (prefix), "//d" (infix).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Stringy.pod, Cast.pod)
    Renamed 3 func invo alt syn exprs: "x" -> "~#" (infix),
    "t" -> "%" (prefix), "r" -> "@" (prefix).

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Set.pod)  Removed the func
    invo alt syn expr "s" (prefix) and updated any code examples using it
    from "s foo" to "Maybe:{foo}".  Converted the func invo alt syn expr
    "v" (Maybe.attr) from prefix format to postcircumfix format; using it
    now looks like "foo.{}" (empty curly quote pair) rather than "v foo".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod)  Added new main pod section "RESOLVING AMBIGUITY"
    which talks about language keywords versus user-defined entities.

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Eliminated the
    "|" sigil from statement names, which are now always sigil-less (and
    typically barewords) instead.  In PTMD_STD, a "stmt_name" grammar token
    is now just a "Name_payload".  In the 2 Perl-STD, the first elem of the
    "stmt_name" node kind is now "s" rather than "|" (so in Perl 6 this is
    usually a Pair); for "named_stmt" it is now "::=" rather than "|::=".

    * (PTMD_STD.pod, HDMD_Perl[6|5]_STD.pod, Basics.pod)  Eliminated the
    "$" sigil from data-entity names, which are now always sigil-less (and
    typically barewords) instead.  In PTMD_STD, a "lex_entity_name" grammar
    token is now just a "Name_payload".  In the 2 Perl-STD, the first elem
    of the "expr_name" and "var_name" node kinds are now "d" rather than
    "$" (so in Perl 6 this is usually a Pair); for an "accessor" node it is
    now "acc" rather than "$.".

    * (Array.pod, Bag.pod, Blob.pod, Boolean.pod, Cast.pod, Integer.pod,
    Interval.pod, Numeric.pod, Ordered.pod, Rational.pod, Relation.pod,
    Routines_Catalog.pod, STDIO.pod, Scalar.pod, Set.pod, Stringy.pod,
    Text.pod, Tuple.pod, Universal.pod, Counted.pod, Temporal.pod)  Updated
    all system-defined routine documentation as per the prior change item,
    so the illustrative routine signatures no longer use the "$" sigils.

2010-05-17

    * Muldis::D version 0.129.1 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-0.129.1.tar.gz.

    * (D.pm, README, Makefile.PL)  Updated any instances of
    "http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo" so that they are fully
    lower-cased, because the mixed case version doesn't work with some web
    browsers; browsers that don't automatically convert it to lowercase get
    a "There currently are no publically-advertised mailman lists" message.

    * Purged this distribution's "Changes" file of practically all change
    details for its approximately 147 releases numbered 0.0.0 thru 0.129.0,
    most of those now just constituting a single bullet-point in total.  If
    you want to see those change descriptions, look either in the version
    control system as of tag "release-0.129.0" or in the archived
    distribution tarball named Muldis-D-0.129.0.tar.gz.

2007-06-20 thru 2007-07-20

    * On 2007-06-20 was the very first CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5", version 0.0.0; it
    bundled the very first CPAN release of "Muldis D" the language spec,
    version 0.0.0.  At this time, the entire existing Muldis D language
    spec was contained in the single file "Language.pod", which had the
    name Muldis::DB::Language.

    * 2007-06-29 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.0.1.

    * 2007-07-11 : Muldis::DB::Language version 0.1.0.

    * On 2007-07-20 was the very last CPAN release, as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz, of "Muldis DB for Perl 5" that bundled the
    Muldis D language spec, version 0.2.0.  After this time the two would
    be released separately, in their own namespaces.

2006-09-15 thru 2007-06-02

    * Started rewriting Rosetta again, but with a name change, since
    "Rosetta" was no longer appropriate for various reasons.  This rewrite
    took the intentionally bad and temporary name QDRDBMS, to be renamed
    again (to Muldis DB) later on.  With the name change allowed for the
    previous version numbering of Rosetta to be dropped, and this rewrite
    would eventually be first released as version zero.

    * QDRDBMS was started in the wake of having had a lot more experience
    in reading up on the truly relational model of data, and was now
    designed fundamentally to be the design and implementation of a new
    turing complete programming language for working with relational
    databases, now called "QDRDBMS D".

    * Made an experimental CPAN release of QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 on
    2007-05-31, which specifically was a quick branch that stripped out all
    the code and just contained the documentation.  This was the only CPAN
    release of the (partial) project under the QDRDBMS name.

    * Shortly after this, QDRDBMS was renamed to its presumably final name
    of "Muldis DB", and its command language to "Muldis D".  But while
    "Muldis D" stuck, "Muldis DB" was fated for a further rename later.

2006-04-14 thru 2006-11-22

    * Started a complementary Perl 6 project named "Relation" which was
    intended to provide native tuple and relation data types for ordinary
    use in Perl 6 programs like other built-in collection types.  It is
    now stagnant; it will likely get un-stuck after Muldis Rosetta sets an
    example for it.

2006-02-01 thru 2006-04-13

    * The first simultaneous releases of the Perl 5 and 6 versions of
    Rosetta's rewrite occurred on 2006-02-01; they were also the first CPAN
    releases of either version.  The Perl 6 one was Pugs release 6.2.11
    (SVN rev 8934).

    * On 2006-02-23 was the first (Perl 5) CPAN release of Rosetta where
    the project was then officially an implementation of "The Third
    Manifesto", the central work of Darwen and Date's DBMS proposal;
    moreover, Rosetta's command language was named "Rosetta D", to be a "D"
    language by the terms of said proposal.

    * On 2006-03-20 was the (Perl 5) release that declared Rosetta was to
    be fundamentally a self-contained relational DBMS (and the core
    distribution would bundle such an implementation of its API) rather
    than "just" a DBMS wrapper; though extensions could still chose to
    operate as wrappers over other DBMSs.

    * On 2006-04-13 was the last CPAN release of the Perl 5 Rosetta, and
    Pugs 6.2.12 (SVN rev 10930), on 2006-06-26, had the corresponding Perl
    6 version; Pugs 6.2.13 (SVN rev 11402), on 2006-10-27, had the last
    CPAN release of Perl 6 Rosetta, with trivial Perl 6 only updates.
    After this, Pugs would have a Muldis Rosetta instead.

2005-12-06 thru 2006-01-31

    * Rosetta started to evolve so that its API and design was based on
    relational algebra, which is a lot of smaller generic constructs that
    can easily be arranged into queries; this is in contrast to the
    previous design based around monolithic and unwieldy SQL "select"
    queries.  Generally speaking, there was increasing influence on the
    design by Hugh Darwen's and Chris Date's proposals on how a truly
    relational DBMS should work.  This time period also saw very little
    code, and almost entirely documentation updates.

2005-12-05

    * Darren Duncan is introduced by David Wheeler to the truly relational
    model of data, in a posting on the Bricolage development list in the
    "Re: [6977] New branch for maintenance of Bricolage 1.10.x." thread.

    * David said that Darren's expressed thought, that compound data types
    in table fields was a violation of first normal form, was in fact a
    misconception about the relational model.  David then referenced a
    recent interview with C. J. Date.

    * This set off a chain of events which was the largest paradigm shift
    to ever affect the Rosetta project.  While the continuing goal of
    Rosetta remained largely the same, the way this was to be accomplished
    would become quite different, and the project would gain a new goal, to
    help improve the design of relational DBMSs themselves.

2005-09-30 thru 2005-12-04

    * Started a full rewrite of Rosetta, with the intent of avoiding being
    over-engineered, and cutting corners in the short term so to get
    something useable at all sooner.  The idea was to focus on vertical
    development first, so that at least a subset of features work earlier,
    taking the development strategy of Perl6-Pugs itself as an example;
    this is in contrast to the more horizontal development strategy of the
    first Rosetta implementation.

    * Moreover, this rewrite was being done simultaneously in both Perl 5
    and Perl 6; each language had its own independent but synchronized
    version, with the Perl 6 one intended to be the main future one that
    guided design decisions, and the Perl 5 one intended to be the one
    production-ready first, to be used until Perl 6 itself was production
    ready.  That co-development was maintained afterwards, and happens with
    the Muldis Rosetta core.

2002-11-12 thru 2005-09-28, plus 2006-01-13

    * Developed and released on CPAN the Rosetta DBMS framework, whose
    intended purpose was to provide rigorous portability of database
    schemas and database-using applications between different SQL DBMS
    products.  A lot of design documentation was produced, as well as some
    code and tests, but while a significant amount of executing code was
    produced, no solution emerged that was actually useable for real work;
    what did get produced was also unnecessarily complicated.

    * The very first CPAN release of anything related to Rosetta was on
    2003-01-05, in the form of DBIx::Portable version 0.01, as
    DBIx-Portable-0.01.tar.gz.

    * A Lightning Talk was also given introducing Rosetta at OSCON 2005;
    but it is Muldis Rosetta instead that will fulfill the promises made in
    it.

2002-06-07

    * Started writing self-contained code components that were explicitly
    designed to enable external code that used them to work seamlessly on
    multiple database products.  Some of this work was reused later in the
    Rosetta DBMS framework et al, and hence 2002 is the start of the
    declared copyright date range for Muldis D language specification.
