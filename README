PREFACE

This distribution features the pure documentation file named Muldis::D
(Formal spec of Muldis D relational DBMS lang) and its support structure.

Read below for how to get support or keep up to date.

DOCUMENTATION READING ORDER

If you want to read all the Muldis D documentation that exists now in
this distribution, I recommend doing so in this order:

   1.       README
   2. (opt) Changes
   3.       lib/Muldis/D.pm
   4.       lib/Muldis/D/Basics.pod
   5.       lib/Muldis/D/Core.pod
       a.       lib/Muldis/D/Core/Types.pod
       b.       lib/Muldis/D/Core/Types_Catalog.pod
       c.       lib/Muldis/D/Core/Routines.pod
       d.       lib/Muldis/D/Core/Routines_Catalog.pod
   6. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Dialect/PTMD_Tiny.pod
   7.       lib/Muldis/D/Dialect/HDMD_Perl_Tiny.pod
   8. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Conventions.pod
   9.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Ordered.pod
  10.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Integer.pod
  11. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Blob.pod
  12.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Text.pod
  13. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Tuple.pod
  14.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Relation.pod
  15.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Set.pod
  16.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Array.pod
  17. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Bag.pod
  18.       lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Rational.pod
  19. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Temporal.pod
  20. (opt) lib/Muldis/D/Ext/Spatial.pod
  21.       lib/Muldis/D/SeeAlso.pod
  22. (opt) TODO

Then you can carry on with anything else.

You may prefer the nicely HTML-formatted versions of the above, which are
available at "http://search.cpan.org/dist/Muldis-D/".

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  The canonical copies are
all linked to through my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/", on the
page called "Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).

For those of you that are interested in the bleeding edge of development, I
have all parts of the Muldis D project in one or more public repositories.
The Muldis D project is in a Git repository whose Git read-access url is
"git://utsl.gen.nz/Muldis-D" and whose Gitweb information url is at
"http://utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=Muldis-D".

You can download slightly older versions of all of my modules from the
public CPAN archives at "http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or
on my own web server at "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/d/perl/".

CPAN also extracts the POD from modules and maintains that documentation in
an organized and searchable fashion.  Their main search site is at
"http://search.cpan.org", and my own DUNCAND author page is at
"http://search.cpan.org/search?author=DUNCAND".

The main CPAN search site url for Muldis D is
"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Muldis-D/"; that is the url you should link to
presently if you want something to consider the "home page" of Muldis D; it
is best to refer people there by default.

You can download my oldest tarred and gzipped distributions from BACKPAN,
at "http://history.perl.org/backpan/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or from my
web server, at "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/d/perl/archives/", right back
to the libdwg 1.0, first released on 2000 July 23.

SUPPORT

Several public email-based forums exist whose main topic is all
implementations of the Muldis D language, especially the Muldis Rosetta
reference implementation.  They exist so that Muldis D / Muldis Rosetta
users can help each other, or that help coming from Muldis D / Muldis
Rosetta developers can be said once to many people, rather than to each
individually.  All of these you can reach via
"http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo".

Alternately, you can purchase more advanced commercial support for various
Muldis D implementations, particularly Muldis Rosetta, from its author by
way of Muldis Data Systems; see "http://www.muldis.com/" for details.

Share and Enjoy!
