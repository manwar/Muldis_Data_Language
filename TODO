                             Language::MuldisD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.  It is specific to
the Muldis D specification distribution only, and doesn't talk about things
that would go in other distributions, including implementations.  (But,
look at lib/Language/MuldisD/SeeAlso.pod for a list of actual or possible
implementations.)

The following list is loosely ordered by priority, but list items may
actually be addressed in a different order.  There is no specific time
table for these items; they are simply to be done "as soon as possible".

* Generally speaking, make a new release to CPAN once every week, assuming
the progress is non-trivial, so there are regular public snapshots with
nicely rendered documentation.

* Flesh out the specs for the Muldis D metamodel, that is, the catalog.
This is the main prerequisite for doing anything moderately more complex
than what has already been done, including the support for user-defined
data types, stored routines, constraints, virtual variables, and persisting
databases.

* Flesh out the list of system-defined operators, including type selectors,
that Muldis D includes.

* Whatever else needs doing, such as, fixing bugs.
