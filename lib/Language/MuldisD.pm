=head1 FORUMS

Several public email-based forums exist whose main topic is all
implementations of the Muldis D language, especially the L<Muldis::DB>
project, which they are named for.  All of these you can reach via
L<http://mm.DarrenDuncan.net/mailman/listinfo>; go there to manage your
subscriptions to, or view the archives of, the following:

=over

=item C<muldis-db-announce@mm.DarrenDuncan.net>

This low-volume list is mainly for official announcements from the
Muldis::DB developers, though developers of Muldis::DB extensions can also
post their announcements here.  This is not a discussion list.

=item C<muldis-db-users@mm.DarrenDuncan.net>

This list is for general discussion among people who are using Muldis::DB,
which is not concerned with the implementation of Muldis::DB itself.  This
is the best place to ask for basic help in getting Muldis::DB installed on
your machine or to make it do what you want.  You could also submit feature
requests or report perceived bugs here, if you don't want to use CPAN's RT
system.

=item C<muldis-db-devel@mm.DarrenDuncan.net>

This list is for discussion among people who are designing or implementing
the Muldis::DB core API (including Muldis D language design), or who are
implementing Muldis::DB Engines, or who are writing core documentation,
tests, or examples.  It is not the place for non-implementers to get help
in using said.

=back

An official IRC channel for Muldis::DB is also intended, but not yet
started.

Alternately, you can purchase more advanced commercial support for various
Muldis D implementations, particularly Muldis::DB, from its author; contact
C<perl@DarrenDuncan.net> for details.
