=head1 NAME

Language::MuldisD::Core -
Muldis D core data types and operators

=head1 VERSION

This document is Language::MuldisD::Core version 0.19.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Language::MuldisD>; you should read that root document
before you read this one, which provides subservient details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Muldis D has a mandatory core set of system-defined (eternally available)
entities, which is referred to as the I<Muldis D core> or the I<core>; they
are the minimal entities that all Muldis D implementations need to provide;
they are mutually self-describing and are used to bootstrap the language;
any entities outside the core, called I<Muldis D extensions>, are
non-mandatory and are defined in terms of the core or each other, but the
reverse isn't true.

This current C<Core> document features the boolean, integer, rational, bit
string, and character string types and operators, plus the tuple and
relation type constructors (and quasi- variants) and operators, plus the
type system minimal and maximal types, plus the special types used to
define the system catalog, and the polymorphic operators that all types, or
some types including core types, have defined over them.

Extensions are in these other documents:
L<Language::MuldisD::Ext::Temporal>, L<Language::MuldisD::Ext::Spatial>.
