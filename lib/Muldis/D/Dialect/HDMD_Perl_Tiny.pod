=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Dialect::HDMD_Perl_Tiny -
How to format Perl Hosted Data Muldis D

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Dialect::HDMD_Perl_Tiny version 0.24.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document
before you read this one, which provides subservient details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document outlines the grammar of the I<Hosted Data Muldis D> dialect
named C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny>.  The fully-qualified name of this Muldis D
dialect, in combination with the base language spec it is bundled with, is
C<Muldis_D:'http://muldis.com':'N.N.N':'HDMD_Perl_Tiny'> (when the bundled
base language version is substituted for the C<N.N.N>).

This dialect is designed to exactly match the Muldis D system catalog (the
possible representation of Muldis D code that is visible to or updateable
by Muldis D programs at runtime) as to what non-critical meta-data it
explicitly stores; so code in the C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny> dialect should be
round-trippable with the system catalog with the result maintaining all the
details that were started with.  Since it matches the system catalog, this
dialect should be able to exactly represent all possible Muldis D base
language code (and probably all extensions too), rather than a subset of
it.  This dialect similarly matches the C<PTMD_Tiny> dialect, which is
documented at L<Muldis::D::Dialect::PTMD_Tiny>; in fact, most of the
details in common with that other dialect are described just in the current
file, for both dialects.

This dialect is designed to be as small as possible while meeting the above
criteria, and is designed such that a parser that handles all of this
dialect can be tiny, hence the dialect's C<Tiny> name.  Likewise, a code
generator for this dialect from the system catalog can be tiny.

The C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny> dialect is defined to be hosted in either Perl 5 or
Perl 6, and as composed of just|mainly core Perl types.  Where Perl 5 and 6
differ, the terminology and examples in this documentation specifically
uses Perl 6 terminology and examples by default, and adds analogous Perl 5
terminology as necessary.

Fundamentally, the various Muldis D scalar and collection types are
represented by their equivalent Perl 5 or 6 native scalar and collection
types.  But since Muldis D is more strongly typed, or at least differently
typed, than Perl, each Muldis D literal is represented by a Perl Array,
whose elements include both the payload Perl literal plus explicit
meta-data for how to interpret that Perl literal for mapping to Muldis D.

This document mainly just specifies a way to represent Muldis D values as
Perl values.  Since the fundamental way to do data definition in Muldis D
is to update catalog (information schema) variables, aka the Muldis D
meta-model, which are themselves just data, then this document only needs
to tell you how to define values to put in the catalog variables.  Defining
data types or routines are done by defining catalog values describing them.

See instead L<Muldis::D::Core> for how to actually define the
tuples and relations that define your data types and routines and queries
and so forth.

For the present, this document will use the term I<PHMD> (I<Perl Hosted
Muldis D>) for brevity when referring to aspects of the Perl-Tiny dialect.

=head1 GENERAL STRUCTURE

A PHMD value is composed mainly of a tree of Perl Array, such that each
Array is a tree node.  The elements of each node/Array include typically a
native Perl payload value, which may be a PHMD value itself, plus meta-data
for that payload, that meta-data typically including the analogy of a class
name, were PHMD nodes instead represented by a tree of PHMD-specific
objects.  As an exception, one kind of PHMD node is not a Perl Array, but
just a Perl C<Str>; if you see a C<Str> where you expect a PHMD node,
assume it is a C<Name> node; this exception is for huffmanizing.

It should be emphasized that no Perl undefined values are allowed anywhere
in a PHMD value; you must use only defined values instead.  This
documentation also assumes that only defined values are used, and that
supplying a Perl undef will result in an error.  If you genuinely want to
represent that a value is unknown or inapplicable, then the C<Nothing> node
type is provided as one way you can explicitly say so.  I<This policy may
be reconsidered.>

=head1 BOOTLOADER

A full or partial Muldis D C<bootloader> routine consists of a language
name declaration plus a series of 0..N imperative routine calls.  A
C<bootloader> is formatted as a PHMD node having 1..N elements, where the
first element is a PHMD node defining a Muldis D "language name", and each
remaining element is a PHMD node defining a "bootloader imperative routine
call".

Examples:

    [
        [ 'Muldis_D', 'http://muldis.com', '1.2.3', 'HDMD_Perl_Tiny', {} ],
        [ 'boot_call', 'sys.std.Core.Cat.create_depot_procedure',
            {}, { ... } ],
    ]

=head1 LANGUAGE NAME

As per the VERSIONING pod section of L<Muldis::D>, code written in
Muldis D must start by declaring the fully-qualified Muldis D language name
it is written in.  The C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny> dialect formats this name as a
PHMD node having the following 5 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type / language base name: the Perl C<Str> value C<Muldis_D>.

=item *

Base authority: a Perl C<Str> as per the payload of a C<Text> node;
typically the Perl C<Str> value C<http://muldis.com>.

=item *

Base version number: a Perl C<Str> as per the payload of a C<Text> node;
typically a Perl C<Str> value like C<1.2.3>.

=item *

Dialect: the Perl C<Str> value C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny>.

=item *

Extensions: a Perl C<Hash|Mapping> as per the payload of a C<Tuple> node;
see the L<MULDIS D TINY DIALECT PRAGMAS> pod section for more details.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Muldis_D', 'http://muldis.com', '1.2.3', 'HDMD_Perl_Tiny', {} ]

    [ 'Muldis_D', 'http://muldis.com', '1.2.3', 'HDMD_Perl_Tiny', {
        'auto_add_attrs'          => [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ],
        'auto_unabbrev_std_names' => [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ],
        'auto_chains_from_names'  => [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ],
    } ]

More specifically, a language name PHMD node like the above would generally
be the input for a Perl Hosted Muldis D implementating virtual machine's
configuration step, which provides a context for subsequent feeding of
other PHMD trees to said virtual machine.

=head1 BOOTLOADER IMPERATIVE ROUTINE CALL

This PHMD node specifies one statement of a Muldis D C<bootloader> routine
which invokes an imperative routine, such statements being what the entire
body of a C<bootloader> is composed of.  A bootloader imperative routine
call is formatted as a PHMD node having the following 4 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<boot_call>.

=item *

Imperative routine name: a Perl C<Array|Seq|Str> as per the payload of a
C<NameChain> PHMD node.

=item *

Imperative routine subject-to-update args: a Perl C<Hash|Mapping> as per
the payload of a C<Tuple> PHMD node except that every C<Hash|Mapping> value
is just a Perl C<Array|Seq|Str> as per the payload of a C<NameChain> PHMD
node (each value is the name of a global variable).

=item *

Imperative routine read-only args: a Perl C<Hash|Mapping> as per the
payload of a C<Tuple> PHMD node.

=back

Examples

    [ 'boot_call', 'sys.std.Core.Cat.create_depot_procedure', {}, { ... } ]

=head1 CORE GENERIC SCALAR VALUES

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Scalar

This node type represents a scalar subtype value.  It has 4 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Scalar>.

=item *

Scalar type name: a Perl C<Array|Seq|Str> as per the payload of a
C<NameChain> PHMD node.

=item *

Possrep name: a Perl C<Str> as per a C<Name> PHMD node.

=item *

The payload: a Perl C<Hash|Mapping> as per the payload of a C<Tuple>
PHMD node.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Scalar> subtype
value whose declared type is specified by the scalar type name (second node
element) and whose attributes are defined by the payload.  The C<Scalar>
PHMD node type can only be used for scalar types that have at least 1
possrep, and the payload is interpreted specifically as attributes of the
declared type's possrep which is specified by the possrep name (third node
element).  Each key+value pair of the payload defines a named possrep
attribute of the new scalar; the pair's key and value are, respectively, a
Perl C<Str> that specifies the possrep attribute name, and a PHMD node that
specifies the possrep attribute value.  (Note that most scalar types have
at least 1 possrep; the only ones that don't are either union types of
types having possreps, or they are core system-defined types, and those all
have their own dedicated syntax for literals.)

Examples:

    [ 'Scalar', 'sys.std.Rational.Type.Rat', 'float', {
        'mantissa' => [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 45207196 ],
        'radix'    => [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 10 ],
        'exponent' => [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 37 ],
    } ]

    [ 'Scalar', 'fed.lib.the_db.WeekDay', 'name', {
        '' => [ 'Text', 'monday' ],
    } ]

    [ 'Scalar', 'fed.lib.the_db.WeekDay', 'number', {
        '' => [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 5 ],
    } ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Bool

This node type represents a logical boolean value.  It has 3 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Bool>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<md_enum>, C<perl_bool>, C<any_perl>.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Bool> value as
follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<md_enum>, then the payload must be a Perl C<Str>
having one of the values C<false>, C<true>.  This format specifically is
what the Plain Text Muldis D grammar uses, and is the result of parsing it.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_bool>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must
be a Perl C<Bool>, and so C<Bool::False> and C<Bool::True> are mapped
directly.  Under Perl 5, the payload must be just the specific result of a
Perl 5 logical expression, such as C<(1 == 0)> or C<(1 == 1)>, and nothing
else; said values are probably the empty string and number 1, respectively.

=item *

If the format is C<any_perl>, then the payload may be any Perl value,
and it is simply coerced into a boolean context as per Perl's own
semantics; typically for built-in scalars, the empty string and number zero
are considered false, and everything else true.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ]

    [ 'Bool', 'perl_bool', Bool::False ] # Perl 6 only

    [ 'Bool', 'perl_bool', (1 == 0) ]

    [ 'Bool', 'perl_any', 42 ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Int

This node type represents an integer value.  It has 3-4 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Int>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<md_int>, C<perl_int>, C<any_perl>.

=item *

Only when format is C<md_int>; the max-col-val.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Int> value as
follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<md_int>, then the max-col-val must be a Perl C<Str>
composed of a single C<[1-9A-Z]> character, and the payload must be a Perl
C<Str> of the format C<0> or C<< \-?<[1-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>* >>.  This format
specifically is what the Plain Text Muldis D grammar uses, and is the
result of parsing it.  The payload is interpreted as a base-I<N> integer
where I<N> might be between 2 and 36, and the given max-col-val says which
possible value of I<N> to use.  Assuming all column values are between zero
and I<N>-minus-one, the max-col-val contains that I<N>-minus-one.  So to
specify, eg, bases [2,8,10,16], use max-col-val of [1,7,9,F].

=item *

If the format is C<perl_int>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must
be a Perl C<Int>, which is mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the payload must
be just a canonical integer value according to Perl.

=item *

If the format is C<any_perl>, then the payload may be any Perl value,
and it is simply coerced into an integer context as per Perl's own
semantics, meaning base-10 where applicable.  If something doesn't look
numeric, it becomes zero; if something looks like a fractional number, it
is truncated.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '1', '11001001' ] # binary

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '7', '0' ] # octal

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '7', '644' ] # octal

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '9', '-34' ] # decimal

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '9', '42' ] # decimal

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', 'F', 'DEADBEEF' ] # hexadecimal

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', 'Z', '-HELLOWORLD' ] # base-36

    [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 21 ]

    [ 'Int', 'any_perl', ' 171 ' ]

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', '3', '301' ] # base-4

    [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 0 ]

    [ 'Int', 'md_int', 'B', 'A09B' ] # base-12

    [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 101 ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Blob

This node type represents a bit string.  It has 3-4 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Blob>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<md_blob>, C<perl_blob>.

=item *

Only when format is C<md_blob>; the max-col-val.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Blob> value as
follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<md_blob>, then the max-col-val must be a Perl
C<Str> composed of a single C<[137F]> character, and the payload must be a
Perl C<Str> of the format C<< <[0-9A-F]>* >>.  This format specifically is
what the Plain Text Muldis D grammar uses, and is the result of parsing it.
Each column of the payload specifies a sequence of one of [1,2,3,4] bits,
depending on whether max-col-val is [1,3,7,F].

=item *

If the format is C<perl_blob>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must
be a Perl C<Blob>, which is mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the payload
must be just a canonical Perl bit string, which is a scalar whose utf-8
flag is false.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Blob', 'md_blob', '1', '00101110100010' ] # binary

    [ 'Blob', 'md_blob', '3', '' ]

    [ 'Blob', 'md_blob', 'F', 'A705E' ] # hexadecimal

    [ 'Blob', 'perl_blob', (pack 'H2', 'P') ]

    [ 'Blob', 'md_blob', '7', '523504376' ]

    [ 'Blob', 'perl_blob', (pack 'H2', 'Z') ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Text

This node type represents a character string.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Text>.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Text> value by
directly mapping the payload.  Note that, while Plain Text Muldis D may
contain a few escape sequences, those would be replaced with what they
represent prior to making a PHMD node.  Under Perl 6, the payload must be a
Perl C<Str>, which is mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the payload must be
just a canonical Perl character string, which is a scalar whose utf-8 flag
is true, or that doesn't contain any octets with a C<1>-valued highest bit.

Examples:

    [ 'Text', 'Ceres' ]

    [ 'Text', 'サンプル' ] # note: Perl 5 needs "use utf8;" pragma to work

    [ 'Text', '' ]

    [ 'Text', 'Perl' ]

=head1 CORE GENERIC NONSCALAR VALUES

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Tuple

This node type represents a tuple value.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Tuple>.

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Hash|Mapping> value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Tuple> value
whose attributes are defined by the payload.  Each key+value pair of the
payload defines a named attribute of the new tuple; the pair's key and
value are, respectively, a Perl C<Str> that specifies the attribute name,
and a PHMD node that specifies the attribute value.

Examples:

    [ 'Tuple', {} ]

    [ 'Tuple', {
        'login_name' => [ 'Text', 'hartmark' ],
        'login_pass' => [ 'Text', 'letmein' ],
        'is_special' => [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ],
    } ]

    [ 'Tuple', {
        'name' => [ 'Text', 'Michelle' ],
        'age'  => [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 17 ],
    } ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Relation

This node type represents a relation value.  It has 2-3 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Relation>.

=item *

Only when the node has 3 elements; ordered attr names; a Perl C<Array|Seq>
value.

=item *

The payload; only when the node has 2 elements, a Perl
C<Array|Seq|Set|KeySet> of C<Str|Hash|Mapping> value; only when the node
has 3 elements, a Perl C<Array|Seq> of C<Array|Seq> value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Relation> value
as follows:

=over

=item *

If the node has 2 elements, then:  The new relation value's
tuples and attribute names are defined by the payload.  Iff the
payload has zero elements, then it defines the only relation value having
zero attributes and zero tuples.  If the payload has elements, then either
the elements must all be C<Str>, or they must all be C<Hash|Mapping>, but
not both kinds in the same payload.  Iff a payload's elements are each
C<Str>, then the payload defines the attribute names of a relation having
zero tuples; each element must be as per the payload of a
C<Name>-defining PHMD node.  Iff a payload's elements are each
C<Hash|Mapping>, then each element of the payload defines a tuple of the
new relation; each element is as per the payload of a tuple-defining PHMD
node; every tuple-defining element of the payload must be of the same
degree and have the same attribute names as its sibling elements; these are
the degree and attribute names of the relation as a whole, which is its
heading for the current purposes.

=item *

If the node has 3 elements, then:  The new relation value's attribute names
are defined by the ordered attr names (second element) and the relation
body's tuples' attribute values are defined by the payload (third element).
This format is meant to be the most compact of the generic relation node
formats, as the attribute names only appear once for the relation rather
than repeating for each tuple.  As a trade-off, the attribute values per
tuple from the third element must appear in the same order as their
corresponding attribute names appear in the second element, as the names
and values in the relation literal are matched up by ordinal position here.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Relation', [] ]

    [ 'Relation', [ {}, ] ]

    [ 'Relation', [ 'x', 'y', 'z', ] ]

    [ 'Relation', [
        {
            'login_name' => [ 'Text', 'hartmark' ],
            'login_pass' => [ 'Text', 'letmein' ],
            'is_special' => [ 'Bool', 'md_enum', 'true' ],
        },
    ] ]

    [ 'Relation', [ 'name', 'age', ], [
        [ [ 'Text', 'Michelle' ], [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 17 ], ],
    ] ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Set

This node type represents a set value.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Set>.

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Array|Seq|Set|KeySet> value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Set> value whose
elements are defined by the payload.  Each element of the payload defines a
unary tuple of the new set; each element is a PHMD node that defines the
C<value> attribute of the tuple.

Examples:

    [ 'Set', [
        [ 'Text', 'Canada' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Spain' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Jordan' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Thailand' ],
    ] ]

    [ 'Set', [
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 3 ],
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 16 ],
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 85 ],
    ] ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Nothing

This node type represents a 'nothing' value; it is interpreted as a Muldis
D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Nothing>.  It has 1 element, which is the Perl C<Str>
value C<Nothing>.

Examples:

    [ 'Nothing' ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Single

This node type represents a 'single' value.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Single>.

=item *

The payload; a PHMD node that defines a single scalar or nonscalar value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Single> value
whose element is defined by the payload.  The payload is a PHMD node that
defines the C<value> attribute of the single tuple of the new 'single'.

Examples:

    [ 'Single', [ 'Text', '2003.07.24' ] ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Array

This node type represents a sequence value.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Array>.

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Array|Seq> value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Array> value
whose elements are defined by the payload.  Each element of the payload
defines a binary tuple of the new sequence; the element value is a PHMD
node that defines the C<value> attribute of the tuple, and the element
index is used as the C<index> attribute of the tuple.

Examples:

    [ 'Array', [
        [ 'Text', 'Alphonse' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Edward' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Winry' ],
    ] ]

    [ 'Array', [
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 57 ],
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 45 ],
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 63 ],
        [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 61 ],
    ] ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Bag

This node type represents a bag value.  It has 3 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Bag>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<aoa_counted>, C<array_repeated>, C<perl_bag> (p6).

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Bag|KeyBag> value or C<Array|Seq> or
C<Array|Seq> of C<Array|Seq>.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Bag> value whose
elements are defined by the payload.  The payload is interpreted as
follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<aoa_counted>, then the payload must be a Perl
C<Array|Seq>, and each element of the payload defines a binary tuple of the
new bag; the element is a 2-element C<Array|Seq>, and those 2 elements, by
index order, are a PHMD node that defines the C<value> attribute of the
tuple, and a 2-3-element C<Array|Seq> (which is the same as an 'Int' PHMD
node minus the first constant element) that defines the C<count> attribute
of the tuple; the count must be a positive integer.

=item *

If the format is C<array_repeated>, then the payload must be a Perl
C<Array|Seq>, and each element of the payload contributes to a binary tuple
of the new bag; the element value is a PHMD node that defines the C<value>
attribute of the tuple.  The bag has 1 tuple for every distinct (after
format normalization) element value in the payload, and the C<count>
attribute of that tuple says how many instances of said element were in the
payload.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_bag>, then the payload must be a Perl 6
(there is no Perl 5 analogy) C<Bag|KeyBag> value; the payload elements are
PHMD nodes corresponding to the C<value> attribute of the new bag's tuples,
and the mapping is as you should expect.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Bag', 'aoa_counted', [
        [
            [ 'Text', 'Apple' ],
            [ 'md_int', '9', '500' ],
        ],
        [
            [ 'Text', 'Orange' ],
            [ 'perl_int', 300 ],
        ],
        [
            [ 'Text', 'Banana' ],
            [ 'perl_int', 400 ],
        ],
    ] ]

    [ 'Bag', 'array_repeated', [
        [ 'Text', 'Foo' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Quux' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Foo' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Bar' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Baz' ],
        [ 'Text', 'Baz' ],
    ] ]

=head1 QUASI- VALUES

Every PHMD node type for a generic scalar or nonscalar literal has a
corresponding extra PHMD node type for a quasi- literal.  The corresponding
extra quasi- node types are exactly the same in format to the non-quasi
types but that for each one of them, the value of its first element has the
Perl C<Str> value C<Quasi> prepended.  So PHMD nodes whose first elements
each are [C<QuasiScalar>, C<QuasiTuple>, C<QuasiRelation>, C<QuasiSet>,
C<QuasiNothing>, C<QuasiSingle>, C<QuasiArray>, C<QuasiBag>] are
interpreted as Muldis D [C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiScalar>,
C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiTuple>, C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiRelation>,
C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiSet>, C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiNothing>,
C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiSingle>, C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiArray>,
C<sys.std.Core.Type.QuasiBag>] values, respectively.

=head1 CATALOG SCALAR VALUES

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Name

This node type represents a canonical short name for any kind of DBMS
entity when declaring it; it is a character string type, that is disjoint
from C<Text>.

Unlike every other PHMD node type, a canonical short name is simply a Perl
C<Str> value, which is its payload; it is not encapsulated in a Perl Array;
this difference is done for huffmanizing reasons, since a short name is
probably the most often used node type, and moreover this change allows for
simplifying other parts of the grammar.

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Name> value
by directly mapping itself / the payload.  Note that, while Plain Text
Muldis D may contain a few escape sequences, those would be replaced with
what they represent prior to making a PHMD node.  The node / its payload
must be as per the payload of a C<Text> PHMD node.

Examples:

    'login_pass'

    'First Name'

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.NameChain

This node type represents a canonical long name for invoking a DBMS
entity in some contexts; it is conceptually a sequence of entity short
names.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<NameChain>.

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Array|Seq> value or C<Str> (char-mode scalar) value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.NameChain>
value as follows:

=over

=item *

If the payload is an C<Array|Seq>, then it must have at least 2 elements,
and every element must be a valid payload for a C<Name> PHMD node (that
is, any Perl character string).  Each element of the payload, in order,
defines an element of the C<array> possrep's attribute of a C<NameChain>.

=item *

If the payload is a C<Str>, then it must be formatted as a catenation
(using period (C<.>) separators) of at least 2 parts, where each part is
escaped such that backslashes, single-quotes, and periods are escaped as
C<\b>, C<\q> and C<\p> respectively; it defines the C<flat> possrep's
attribute of a C<NameChain>.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'NameChain', ['fed','data','the_db','gene','sorted_person_name'] ]

    [ 'NameChain', 'fed.data.the_db.stats.samples_by_order' ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.DeclNameChain

This node type represents a canonical long name for declaring a DBMS entity
in N-depth contexts; it is conceptually a sequence of entity short names.
It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<DeclNameChain>.

=item *

The payload; a Perl C<Array|Seq> value or C<Str> (char-mode scalar) value.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D
C<sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.DeclNameChain> value as follows:

=over

=item *

If the payload is an C<Array|Seq>, then every element must be a valid
payload for a C<Name> PHMD node (that is, any Perl character string).
Each element of the payload, in order, defines an element of the C<array>
possrep's attribute of a C<DeclNameChain>.

=item *

If the payload is a C<Str>, then it must be formatted as a catenation of
0..N parts (starting with a period (C<.>) and each part ending with a
period), where each part is escaped such that backslashes, single-quotes,
and periods are escaped as C<\b>, C<\q> and C<\p> respectively; it defines
the C<flat> possrep's attribute of a C<DeclNameChain>.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'DeclNameChain', ['gene','sorted_person_name'] ]

    [ 'DeclNameChain', '.stats.samples_by_order.' ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Comment

This node type represents the text of a Muldis D code comment; it is a
character string type, that is disjoint from both C<Text> and C<Name>.  It
has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Comment>.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Comment>
value by directly mapping the payload.  Note that, while Plain Text Muldis
D may contain a few escape sequences, those would be replaced with what
they represent prior to making a PHMD node.  The payload must be as per the
payload of a C<Text> PHMD node.

Examples:

    [ 'Comment', 'This does something.' ]

=head2 sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Order

This node type represents an order-determination.  It has 3 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Order>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<md_enum>, C<perl_order>.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Core.Type.Cat.Order> value
as follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<md_enum>, then the payload must be a Perl C<Str> having
one of the values C<increase>, C<same>, C<decrease>, C<-1>, C<0>, C<1>
(note that each of the 3 C<Cat.Order> values has 2 possreps that are
directly expressable here).  This format specifically is what the Plain
Text Muldis D grammar uses, and is the result of parsing it.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_order>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must be a
Perl C<Order>, and so C<Order::Increase> and C<Order::Same> and
C<Order::Decrease> are mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the payload must be
just the specific result of a Perl 5 order-determining expression, such as
C<< (1 <=> 2) >> or C<< (1 <=> 1) >> or C<< (2 <=> 1) >>, and nothing else;
said values are probably the numbers [C<-1>, C<0>, C<1>], respectively.

=back

Examples:

    [ 'Order', 'md_enum', 'same' ]

    [ 'Order', 'perl_order', Order::Increase ] # Perl 6 only

    [ 'Order', 'perl_order', (2 <=> 1) ]

=head1 RATIONAL EXTENSION SCALAR VALUES

=head2 sys.std.Rational.Type.Rat

This node type represents a rational value.  It has 3-4 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<Rat>.

=item *

Format; one of: C<md_radix>, C<md_ratio>, C<md_float>, C<perl_rat>,
C<perl_float>, C<perl_int_ratio>, C<perl_int_float>, C<any_perl>,
C<any_perl_ratio>, C<any_perl_float>.

=item *

Only when format is C<md_radix>|C<md_ratio>|C<md_float>; the max-col-val.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D C<sys.std.Rational.Type.Rat> value
as follows:

=over

=item *

If the format is C<md_radix>, then the max-col-val must be a Perl C<Str>
composed of a single C<[1-9A-Z]> character, and the payload must be a Perl
C<Str> of the format C<< 0\.?<[0-9A-Z]>* >> or C<<
\-?<[1-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>*\.?<[0-9A-Z]>* >>.  This format specifically is
what the Plain Text Muldis D grammar uses ('radix' option), and is the
result of parsing it.  The payload is interpreted as a base-I<N> rational
where I<N> might be between 2 and 36, and the given max-col-val says which
possible value of I<N> to use.  Assuming all column values are between zero
and I<N>-minus-one, the max-col-val contains that I<N>-minus-one.  So to
specify, eg, bases [2,8,10,16], use max-col-val of [1,7,9,F].

=item *

If the format is C<md_ratio>, then the max-col-val must be as per
C<md_radix>, and the payload must be a 2-element C<Array|Seq> where the
first element is a Perl C<Str> of the format C<0> or C<<
\-?<[1-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>* >> (an integer) and the second element is a Perl
C<Str> of the format C<< <[1-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>* >> (a positive integer).
The payload is interpreted as per C<md_radix> but that its value comes from
the first element (a numerator) divided by the second (a denominator).
Note that while the C<md_radix> format is limited to representing rationals
whose denominator is a power of some I<N> between 2 and 36, the C<md_ratio>
format can represent those with any I<N> that is greater than or equal to
2, such as 1/43.

=item *

If the format is C<md_float>, then the max-col-val must be as per
C<md_radix>, and the payload must be a 3-element C<Array|Seq> where the
first element is a Perl C<Str> of the format C<0> or C<<
\-?<[1-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>* >> (an integer) and the second element is a Perl
C<Str> of the format C<< <[2-9A-Z]><[0-9A-Z]>* >> (an integer greater than
1) and the third element is as per the first (an integer).  The payload is
interpreted as per C<md_radix> but that its value comes from the first
element (a mantissa) multiplied by the result of the second element (a
radix) taken to the power of the third (an exponent).  Note that while the
C<md_ratio> format can represent all rationals, the very large or very
small ones would be quite verbose written in that format, and so the
C<md_float> format allows writing those values in a more terse fashion,
such as 1.56*10^37.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_rat>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must be a
Perl C<Rat> (or C<Num>), which is mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the
payload must be just a canonical rational or numeric value according to
Perl.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_float>, then:  Under Perl 6, the payload must be a
Perl C<Float> (or C<Num>), which is mapped directly.  Under Perl 5, the
payload must be just a canonical floating-point or numeric value according
to Perl.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_int_ratio>, then the payload must a 2-element
C<Array|Seq> where each element must be a canonical integer (or positive
integer, respectively) to Perl as per defining a C<perl_int>; the
rational's value is interpreted as the first element divided by the second.

=item *

If the format is C<perl_int_float>, then the payload must a 3-element
C<Array|Seq> where each element must be a canonical integer (or integer
greater than 2, or integer, respectively) to Perl as per defining a
C<perl_int>; the rational's value is interpreted as the first element
multiplied by the result of the second element taken to the power of the
third.

=item *

If the format is C<any_perl>, then the payload may be any Perl value,
and it is simply coerced into a numeric context as per Perl's own
semantics, meaning base-10 where applicable.  If something doesn't look
numeric, it becomes zero.

=item *

If the format is C<any_perl_ratio>, then the payload is as per
C<perl_int_ratio> but that each array element is simply coerced into an
integer context.  If Perl's coercion of the denominator produces an integer
less than 1, it becomes a 1.  I<This may be revised to fail instead.>

=item *

If the format is C<any_perl_float>, then the payload is as per
C<perl_int_float> but that each array element is simply coerced into an
integer context.  If Perl's coercion of the radix produces an integer
less than 2, it becomes a 2.  I<This may be revised to fail instead.>

=back

    [ 'Rat', 'md_radix', '1', '-1.1' ]

    [ 'Rat', 'md_radix', '9', '-1.5' ] # same val as prev

=head2 sys.std.Rational.Type.RatRoundMeth

This node type represents a rounding method.  It has 2 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<RatRoundMeth>.

=item *

The payload.

=back

This node is interpreted as a Muldis D
C<sys.std.Rational.Type.RatRoundMeth> value by directly mapping the
payload.  The payload must be a Perl C<Str> having one of the 7 values
C<half_down>, C<half_up>, C<half_even>, C<to_floor>, C<to_ceiling>,
C<to_zero>, C<to_inf>.

Examples:

    [ 'RatRoundMeth', 'half_up' ]

=head1 TREAT AS TYPE

This PHMD node is a lexical-scoped pragma that may be used where any
literal value representing PHMD node may be used.  It has 3 elements:

=over

=item *

Node type: the Perl C<Str> value C<treat_as_type>.

=item *

Type name: a Perl C<Array|Seq|Str> as per the payload of a C<NameChain>
PHMD node.

=item *

The payload; a PHMD node that defines a single value.

=back

This node is used just to provide meta-data for its sole child node, which
typically is a tuple or relation literal.  By default, when defining a
nonscalar literal using a PHMD node tree, the resulting nonscalar value is
"just a tuple|relation".  If that literal is then a sub-literal used as
either a scalar possrep attribute value or as an argument to a
bootloader-invoked routine, the known declared type of that scalar possrep
attribute or routine parameter would provide a context such that the
expected specific type of the nonscalar value, such as what attributes it
should have, can be gleaned, and then it would be known what type the
nonscalar literal is supposed to belong to.  But in some contexts, such as
when the declared type of the routine parameter is simply C<Relation>,
there isn't enough information in the normal context to know what attribute
names and types the new nonscalar should have.  So the C<treat_as_type>
PHMD node type can then be used by the programmer to explicitly tell the
Tiny dialect parser what the specific type of the nonscalar is.  The
literal being annotated is provided by the payload 3rd node element, and
the type name it is being annotated with is given in the type name 2nd node
element.  Using C<treat_as_type> is useful to enable some kinds of
compile-time type checking, and it also helps the C<auto_add_attrs> pragma
to work in many places where it otherwise lacks information needed to work.

Examples:

    [ 'treat_as_type', 'fed.lib.the_db.gene.Person',
        [ 'Relation', [ 'name', 'age', ], [
            [ [ 'Text', 'Michelle' ], [ 'Int', 'perl_int', 17 ], ],
        ] ]
    ]

=head1 MULDIS D TINY DIALECT PRAGMAS

All of the following pragmas apply to both the C<PTMD_Tiny> and
C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny> dialects, and have the same semantics with both.

=head2 auto_add_attrs

All Muldis D values, besides scalars lacking any possreps, are defined in
terms of a collection of attribute values, and there is no such thing as an
attribute being undefined; normally when one selects a value of a
particular attribute-based type, they must supply values for I<all> of its
attributes; this is true with values comprising the system catalog as with
any other values.  Code written in the Muldis D C<PTMD_Tiny> or
C<HDMD_Perl_Tiny> dialect is comprised almost entirely of value literals,
and by default all of the attribute values of said values must be
explicitly given in the literals as sub-literals, even in the common case
where some attributes just have the default values for their type.

While this fact allows for parsers to be very simple and for sub-literals
to be compilable into values without knowing the context they're compiled
into, it means that programmers would have to write maybe about twice as
much code as they otherwise would if they could simply not write out the
default-valued attributes.

If the 5th I<Extensions> portion of the fully-qualified Muldis D language
name contains a name+value pair of C<auto_add_attrs> + C<Bool:true>, then
this activates the optional C<auto_add_attrs> pragma, which provides one
kind of automatic code completion.  When C<auto_add_attrs> is active,
programmers may omit any literal attributes that they want, and those
attributes will be automatically defined by the parser to have the default
values for their type.  Or more specifically, the wider literal whose
attributes are missing will be extended to become the default value of the
type of the wider literal but that those attributes of its that I<were>
explicitly given will override the default's values for those attributes.
The actual behaviour is essentially what the
C<sys.std.Tuple.substitution_in_default> function does.

But the C<auto_add_attrs> pragma is not simply an automatically invoked
pre-processing Muldis D function, because it also serves the common case
where one is defining relation literals that have different attributes
specified per tuple; such a thing by itself isn't even valid as a generic
relation, so it certainly can't be given to a Muldis D function; so the
pragma has at least that advantage unique to itself.

Note that the lexer is exactly the same regardless of whether the
C<auto_add_attrs> pragma is turned on or off, because the matters of
missing attributes were never tested or enforced at the lexical level in
the first place; rather the pragma only affects the parsing stage that
follows the lexing.  In other words, the actual syntax or grammar is
identical regardless of the setting of this pragma.

Now one consequence of using the C<auto_add_attrs> pragma is that in
general the parser must be more complicated, and read type definitions from
the DBMS information schema so that it knows what attributes each literal
is supposed to have, and their declared types, and also sub-literals can no
longer in general be fully converted to values in isolation; now the
parent-most literal must be evaluated first, because its declared type
generally determines the declared types of its attributes, and then their
attributes recursively.  For non-scalar types, the initial declared type
being looked at is the declared type of the bootloader-invoked routine's
parameter that the literal is being given to as an argument.

Now if the declared type of said parameter is just a generic type, such as
C<Relation> or C<Array>, then often no information can be gleaned from this
context for what attributes should exist, and so you will need to wrap the
argument literal in a C<treat_as_type> literal that explicitly provides the
specific type information needed; otherwise, C<auto_add_attrs> won't help
you and you must then fully define relation values with the same attributes
per tuple.  But fortunately for brevity, a lot of the places where
C<auto_add_attrs> would help you the most is when the bootloader is
invoking system-defined data-defining procedures, and their parameters are
all of attribute-specifying types, and it is in such data definition that
you may be most likely to face a large number of default-valued attributes,
such as C<comment>.

Note that the reason the C<auto_add_attrs> behaviour is turned off by
default is twofold.  First, the parser can be a lot simpler / more tiny
with it off.  Second, requiring users to explicitly define even
default-valued attributes can make the code more self-documenting and can
help users avoid some kinds of bugs due to action from unseen values, or
due to some default values "silently" changing between language versions.
So then essentially, turning on C<auto_add_attrs> means the programmer is
telling the parser "I know what I'm doing" by I<explicitly> asking for
potentially less-safe behaviour.  Of course, even with C<auto_add_attrs>
turned on, you can still explicitly define attribute values that are their
type's default values, so it is possible to compromise such as you like.

Also note that it should be trivial for a Muldis D implementation to let
users input code written with C<auto_add_attrs> turned on, and then output
the version of that code for their perusal with it turned off, so they can
see what extra values were filled in without having to manually write said.

=head2 auto_unabbrev_std_names

Normally when one is specifying a C<Cat.NameChain> literal that is a
reference to a standard system-defined type or routine, they must write out
the name in full, starting with C<sys.std> and so on through the unique
part of the entity name.  While this allows for clearly self-documenting
code, as well as for relatively simple parsers, it can also be added tedium
to programmers that would prefer to write out the names in a less verbose
manner, especially since to a point, a slightly more complicated parser
could still unambiguously resolve a much shorter substring of the name.

If the 5th I<Extensions> portion of the fully-qualified Muldis D language
name contains a name+value pair of C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> +
C<Bool:true>, then this activates the optional C<auto_unabbrev_std_names>
pragma, which provides one kind of automatic code completion.  When
C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> is active, programmers may omit any number of
consecutive leading chain elements from such a C<Cat.NameChain> literal, so
long as the remaining unqualified chain is distinct among all standard
system-defined (C<sys.std>-prefix) DBMS entities (but that as an exception,
a non-distinct abbreviation is allowed iff exactly 1 of the candidate
entities is in the language core, C<sys.std.Core>-prefix, in which case
that 1 is unambiguously the entity that is resolved to).  This feature has
no effect on the namespace prefixes like C<tuple_from> or C<array_of>; one
still writes those as normal prepended to the otherwise shortened chains.

So for example, one can just write C<Int> rather than
C<sys.std.Core.Type.Int>, C<is_identical> rather than
C<sys.std.Core.Universal.is_identical>, C<Tuple.attr> rather than
C<sys.std.Core.Tuple.attr>, C<min> rather than C<sys.std.Ordered.min>,
C<array_of.Rat> rather than C<array_of.sys.std.Rational.Type.Rat>, and so
on.

The C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> pragma intentionally does not empower auto
un-abbreviations of any namespaces other than C<sys.std>, to keep things
simple for users to predict and for systems to implement; it does not
affect C<sys.(imp|cat)>, nor any other top-level namespace.  When one is
referencing either any system-defined implementation-specific
(non-standard) types or routines, or any user-defined types or routines, or
any dbvars or constraints or whatever, their names can not be written
abbreviated due to the C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> pragma.

Note that the lexer is exactly the same regardless of whether the
C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> pragma is turned on or off, as per the
C<auto_add_attrs> pragma.  Many other comments about the other pragma also
apply to this one.

=head2 auto_chains_from_names

Iff both the C<auto_add_attrs> and C<auto_unabbrev_std_names> pragmas are
active, then the optional C<auto_chains_from_names> dependent pragma may be
activated in the same manner (as an I<Extensions> name+value pair with
C<Bool:true>.  When C<auto_chains_from_names> is active, programmers may
write an otherwise abbreviated-to-one-chain-element C<Cat.NameChain>
literal as a plain C<Cat.Name> literal; this can chop the literal down to a
third or fourth of its otherwise-length such as in the case of a reference
to the C<Int> type.  When the parent literal of such a faux-C<Cat.Name>
literal is examined for missing attributes, or examined that existing
attributes are of the correct type, any attributes whose declared type says
they are supposed to be C<Cat.NameChain> but that have an explicitly
defined C<Cat.Name> child literal will have that literal mapped to and
replaced with a single element C<Cat.NameChain> literal, which can be
subsequently un-abbreviated into a standard system-defined type or routine
name.  The C<auto_chains_from_names> pragma will not work when the declared
type being applied to a faux-C<Cat.Name> is not a C<Cat.NameChain> subtype,
and such literals will then be taken as actual C<Cat.Name>; where such
declared type information is missing, you will need to write out the
abbreviated chain as an actual C<Cat.NameChain> literal.  Note that the
C<auto_chains_from_names> pragma has no effect on C<Cat.NameChain> literal
bodies that don't comprise the payload portion of their parent literal,
such as with the imperative routine name composed into a C<boot_call>
literal; literal bodies in those positions will always be interpreted
according to C<Cat.NameChain> literal body syntax.
