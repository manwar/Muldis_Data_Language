=head1 NAME

Muldis::D::Ext::Spatial -
Muldis D extension for spatial data types and operators

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Ext::Spatial version 0.6.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document
before you read this one, which provides subservient details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Muldis D has a mandatory core set of system-defined (eternally available)
entities, which is referred to as the I<Muldis D core> or the I<core>; they
are the minimal entities that all Muldis D implementations need to provide;
they are mutually self-describing and are used to bootstrap the language;
any entities outside the core, called I<Muldis D extensions>, are
non-mandatory and are defined in terms of the core or each other, but the
reverse isn't true.

This current C<Spatial> document describes the system-defined I<Muldis D
Spatial Extension>, which consists of spatial and/or geometric data types
and operators.

This current document does not describe the polymorphic operators that all
types, or some types including core types, have defined over them; said
operators are defined once for all types in L<Muldis::D::Core>.

I<This documentation is pending.>

=head1 TYPE SUMMARY

Following are all the data types described in this document, arranged in a
type graph according to their proper sub|supertype relationships (but that
the first 3 just reappear from the core set to provide a similar context,
and aren't re-described here):

    sys.Core.Universal.Universal

        sys.Core.Universal.Empty

        sys.Core.Scalar.Scalar

            # The following are all regular non-ordered scalar types.

            sys.Spatial.Spatial.Geometry
                sys.Spatial.Spatial.Point
                sys.Spatial.Spatial.Curve
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.LineString
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.CircularString
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.CompoundCurve
                sys.Spatial.Spatial.Surface
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.CurvePolygon
                        sys.Spatial.Spatial.Polygon
                sys.Spatial.Spatial.GeometryCollection
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.MultiPoint
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.MultiCurve
                        sys.Spatial.Spatial.MultiLineString
                    sys.Spatial.Spatial.MultiSurface
                        sys.Spatial.Spatial.MultiPolygon

=head1 SYSTEM-DEFINED SPATIAL SCALAR DATA TYPES

These non-core scalar data types describe common kinds of spatial or
geometric figures.  I<Of course, dealing with these types in general isn't
a perfect science; they stand to be revised or rewritten.>
