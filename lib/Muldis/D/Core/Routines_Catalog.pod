Muldis::D::Core::Routines_Catalog -
Muldis D data definition routines

=head1 VERSION

This document is Muldis::D::Core::Routines_Catalog version 0.0.0.

=head1 PREFACE

This document is part of the Muldis D language specification, whose root
document is L<Muldis::D>; you should read that root document before
you read this one, which provides subservient details.  Moreover, you
should read the L<Muldis::D::Core> document before this current
document, as that forms its own tree beneath a root document branch.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document contains one or more sections that were moved here from
L<Muldis::D::Core> so that that other document would not be too large.

These core routines are more special-purpose in nature and are intended for
use in working with the system catalog.  Generally speaking they comprise
the system-defined data definition routines of Muldis D.
